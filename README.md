Lab Activity #1

1. What is a website. and how is it different from a web application?
   - For me, website is a collection of dynamic content, while a web application is an interactive program that performs specific tasks for users.
2. Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites?
   - Websites help schools and offices connect with people by sharing important info, looking professional, and making it easy for everyone
3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?
   - The challenge for me is the struggle with understanding the version control and figuring out all those command line.
4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?
   - It's like revisiting an old project/activity; a detailed README would be a lifesaver, reminding me of the project's/activity's purpose so I don't get totally lost trying to figure out what I did and why.
